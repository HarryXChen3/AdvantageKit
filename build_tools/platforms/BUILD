# Creates a new "constraint" category, which can have one or more "values"
# A constraint is used to define the properties of a specific platform.
# All platforms have an operating system and a CPU type, but we often wish to
# define additional properties of a platform to more completely specify it.
# In this case, we create a category called "device" to differentiate between
# different physical device types.  There can be many devices running Linux
# and using an ARMv7 CPU, but the roboRIO for example is a very specific device
# within that set.  Since the roboRIO has a specific compiler, we need a way
# to differentiate it from other Linux ARM devices.
